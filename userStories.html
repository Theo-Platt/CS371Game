    <h2>1.1: Animations</h2>
    <p>Intro: As a player I want to see smooth animations in the game to make it visually appealing. </br></p>
    <p>Elaboration: Animations will be a large part of the fighting aspect of the game. They must look nice and semi-realistic.</br></p>
    <p>Constraints: 2-Dimensional Graphics </br></p>
    <p>Effort Estimation: 20 person hours  </br></p>
    <p>Acceptance Test: Create sprites for a specific task and code specific task to showcase animation. </br></p>

    <h2>1.2: Tutorial</h2>
    <p>Intro: As a player, I want to be offered an tutorial page and a move-list so that I learn how to play. </br></p>
    <p>Elaboration: Each game has individual controls and commands. A tutorial will be useful to help users navigate the game mechanics.</br></p>
    <p>Constraints: none </br></p>
    <p>Effort Estimation: 2 person hours </br></p>
    <p>Acceptance Test: Create "tutorial" button next to "play" button (on the main menu) to offer more usability than an in-game walkthrough. </br></p>

    <h2>1.3: Balance</h2>
    <p>Intro: As a player, I want to see the fighting types and stat distribution balanced against each other so that the gameplay is fair. </br></p>
    <p>Elaboration: The game will have different types of fighters. They should all be equally powerful in their own way so that the matches rely on users' strategies.</br></p>
    <p>Constraints: none </br></p>
    <p>Effort Estimation: 8 person hours </br></p>
    <p>Acceptance Test: Let players demo the game and test that they are all generally balanced against each type. </br></p>

    <h2>1.4 Items</h2>
    <p>Intro: As a player, I expect items to work as advertised so that I can use them to my advantage. </br></p>
    <p>Elaboration: Each item has a different purpose. If I decide to use one of the items, I expect it to do what it's supposed to.</br></p>
    <p>Constraints: none </br></p>
    <p>Effort Estimation: 15 person hours </br></p>
    <p>Acceptance Test: Players will try each item in a fight to ensure it works as intended. </br></p>

    <h2>1.5 Non-Playable Characters</h2>
    <p>Intro: As a player, I want the NPCs to fight me in a logical way so that the game is challenging, yet doable. </br></p>
    <p>Elaboration: The NPCs should not be overpowered compared to a player, but their moves should make sense and pose somewhat of a threat to the user. They will have to be programmed with an AI. </br></p>
    <p>Constraints: none </br></p>
    <p>Effort Estimation: 10 person hours </br></p>
    <p>Acceptance Test: Players will demo battles with NPCs and determine if their algorithm is accurate. </br></p>

    <h2>1.6 Navigation </h2>
    <p>Intro: As a player, I expect to have some kind of lobby or cutscene so that I can transition between different battles. </br></p>
    <p>Elaboration: Players will fight a variety of enemies. There must be logical way to move them between enemies so that the story line runs smoothly. </br></p>
    <p>Constraints: No open-world character movements </br></p>
    <p>Effort Estimation: 10 person hours</br></p>
    <p>Acceptance Test: A player will demo moving between fights and decide if the transition makes sense and goes smoothly. </br></p>

    <h2>1.7 Progress metric </h2>
    <p>Intro: As a player, I want to see either an HP bar or an HP number meter and I want it to modulate proportionate to my attack so that I can see the battle's progress. </br></p>
    <p>Elaboration: The HP meter must be free of bugs, e.g. a strong attack with weak destructive power (the HP not moving or not moving the right amount), a quantity of zero HP not prompting the end of the battle, etc. </br></p>
    <p>Constraints: none </br></p>
    <p>Effort Estimation: 7 person hours</br></p>
    <p>Acceptance Test: Attacks correspond to appropriate changes in HP, and HP = 0 always prompts the end of the match, along with a allocation/declaration of victory/loss status. </br></p>
    
    <h2>1.8 Player Stats</h2>
    <p>Intro: As a player, I expect my character's stats to have a direct impact on battles.</br></p>
    <p>Elaboration: If I work hard to strengthen my character's stats, I want the difference to be reflected in my fights. For instance, if my character has high evasiveness, I expect them to dodge attacks an appropriate proportion of the time.</br></p>
    <p>Constraints: none</br></p>
    <p>Effort Estimation: 10 person hours </br></p>
    <p>Acceptance Test: Run demo battles with characters of various stat distribution. Track their performance and cross-reference with their stats to ensure that they follow the same trend.</p>

    <h2>1.9 Save Progress</h2>
    <p>Intro: As a player, I want my progress through the game to be recorded and saved.</br></p>
    <p>Elaboration: I don't want to start over every time I open up the game; I want it to save my progress when I leave, so that I can pick up where I left off when I return.</br></p>
    <p>Constraints: none </br></p>
    <p>Effort Estimation: 5 person hours </br></p>
    <p>Acceptance Test: Have a customer play the game, save their progress, close the game, and reopen. See if their progress was successfully recorded.</p>

    <h2>1.10 Moves</h2>
    <p>Intro: As a player, I want my character's moves to work as they say they will.</br></p>
    <p>Elaboration: There moves that will attack enemies, heal the player, or change stats. Each move should do what it is meant to do.</br></p>
    <p>Constraints: none </br></p>
    <p>Effort Estimation: 10 person hours</br></p>
    <p>Acceptance Test: A player will test each attack in demo battles. They will ensure that each attack functions as intended. </p>
