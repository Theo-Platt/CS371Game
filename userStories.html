    <h2>1.1: Animations</h2>
    <p>Intro: As a player I want to see smooth animations in the game. </br></p>
    <p>Elaboration: Animations will be a large part of the fighting aspect of the game. They must be visually appealing and semi-realistic.</br></p>
    <p>Constraints:  none   </br></p>
    <p>Effort Estimation:  20 person hours  </br></p>
    <p>Acceptance Test:  Create sprites for a specific task and code specific task to showcase animation. </br></p>

    <h2>1.2: Tutorial</h2>
    <p>Intro: As a player, I want to be offered an tutorial page and a move-list so that I learn how to play. </br></p>
    <p>Elaboration: Each game has individual controls and commands. A tutorial will be useful to help users navigate the game mechanics.</br></p>

    <p>Effort Estimation: 2 person hours     </br></p>

    <p>Intro: As a player, I want to see the fighting types balanced against each other so that the gameplay is fair. </br></p>
    <p>Elaboration: The game will have different types of fighters. They should all be equally powerful in their own way so that the matches rely on users' strategies.</br></p>
    <p>Constraints: none </br></p>
    <p>Effort Estimation: 8 person hours </br></p>
    <p>Acceptance Test: Let players demo the game and test that they are all generally balanced against each type. </br></p>

    <p>Intro: As a player, I expect items to work as advertised so that I can use them to my advantage. </br></p>
    <p>Elaboration: Each item has a different purpose. If I decide to use one of the items, I expect it to do what it's supposed to.</br></p>
    <p>Constraints: none </br></p>
    <p>Effort Estimation: 20 person hours </br></p>
    <p>Acceptance Test: Players will demo the fights and try each item to ensure it works. </br></p>
