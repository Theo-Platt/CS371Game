      <h2>About:</h2>
	   <p>We have created a turn-based battling game. Players can choose to play as one of four types of wizard: Fire, Air, Water, and Earth. They battle against non-playable, AI opponents. Players can use a variety of moves to heal themselves, damage opponents, or change the game stats (which are speed, accuracy, and evasiveness). Once either the player or opponent health stat drops to 0, the battle is over. </p>
