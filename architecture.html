		<h2>Project Overview</h2>
		<p>This project will be a turn-based combat system in which players can fight Non-Playable Characters. It will include a variety of players stats (such as health, speed, evasiveness, and accuracy) as well as different moves that can heal the player, attack the opponent, or manipulate stats. It will have a simple map, which leads the player into our pokemon-style combat encounters.<br></p>

		<h2>Key Architecture Drivers</h2>
		<p>We need our system to:<br>1. Have a turn-based battle system<br>2. Have a map/world to transition between battles<br>All other requirements fall under these two categories, so we decided to base our architecture designs off these key points.<br></p>

		<h2>Architecture Style Choices</h2>
		<p>For the battle system, we will implement a <i><b>factory architecture style.</b></i> We will create a factory function that will generate an enemy object with unique type/stats, then return a reference to that object. We also plan to use function overloading so that our factory can work with a variety of parameters (i.e., if we want the enemy to have a set type). We considered using a cloning architecture to create new enemies from existing prototypes, but we decided that the factory style would allow for more flexibility for creating enemies.<br>
		   For our map, we will use an <i><b>observer architecture style.</b></i> When the user presses a button to move their character or start a battle, an observer will notify the appropriate objects of the change in state, which will trigger other actions (such as walking animations or a transition into the battle screen). We decided that this would be more efficient than a notification system, which would spend too much time polling.<br></p>

		<h2>Our Architecture</h2>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>We will be using the factory architecture design to generate our fighters, and the observer architecture design to implement our map.<br>
		One possible issue is that neither architecture works with storing player information. We want the playersâ€™ stats, attacks, and experience to be saved between battles, so we would have to find another way to store that data.<br>
		A question that we have is, how we should connect the two architecture designs together so that they work together?<br>
