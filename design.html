    <h2>Architecture Style Choices</h2>
		<p>For the battle system, we will implement a <i><b>pipe and filter architecture style.</b></i> The input will be the moves chosen by the fighters in the battle. The move will be modified using filters such as player stats, opponent stats, fighter types, and attack type. Ultimately, all of this information combined will output as total damage dealt.<br>
		   For our map, we will use a <i><b>repository architecture style.</b></i> The map will act as the data store. Our player character will be the component that reads the data from the map and updates it depending on where the user goes.<br></p>
