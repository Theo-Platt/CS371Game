    <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
	<p>For our program, we are going to develop a game in which players can have turn-based battles. The goal is for a simple battle system to be implemented in which a player may fight NPC enemies. The player will have a set of moves which they may use to win the combat. Player characters will have stats which help determine their performance. There will be types which have specialities and counters.</br></br></br></p>
	<h2>Requirements</h2>
	<h3>Necessary</h3>
	<p>Combat system, based on turns where players may use one of several moves available to them.
</br></br></p>
	<p>Player character will have a series of stats, which helps determine how well the character performs. These stats include health, speed, evasiveness, and accuracy.
</br></br></p>
	<p>Moves may: Heal player health, damage opponent health, buff player stats, debuff opponent stats, buff/debuff general types.
</br></br></p>
	<p>Health: Primary part of combat. When it hits zero, combat is over.
</br></br></p>
	<p>Speed: Determines which player/opponent takes the first turn.
</br></br></p>
	<p>Evasiveness: Determines likelihood of character dodging opponentâ€™s attack. (Counters accuracy)
</br></br></p>
	<p>Accuracy: Determines likelihood of attacks landing. (Counters evasiveness)
</br></br></p>
	<p>Types are a set of elements which the player character may specialize in. Each will have various advantages/disadvantages with regard to other types, and will have their own specialities. There are four types total: Water, Air, Fire, and Earth.
</br></br></p>
	<p>Non-playable, AI opponents for the player to fight.
</br></br></p>
	<p>Default characters: Pre-set characters with a set appearance and move set depending on which type the user selects.
