    <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
	<p>For our program we are going to develop a game in which players can have battles. The goal is for a simple turn based battle system to be implemented, in which a player may fight npc enemies. The player will have a set of moves which they may use to win the combat. Player characters will have stats which help determine their performance. There will be types which have specialities, and counters.</br></br></br></p>
	<h2>Requirements</h2>
	<h3>Necessary</h3>
	<p>Combat system, based on turns where each turn players may use one of several moves available to them.
</br></br></p>
	<p>Player character will have a series of stats, which helps determine how well the character performs. These stats may include health, speed, evasiveness, or accuracy.
</br></br></p>
	<p>Moves may: heal player health, damage opponent health, buff player stats, debuff opponent stats, buff/debuff general types.
</br></br></p>
	<p>Health: primary part of combat, when hits zero, combat is over.
</br></br></p>
	<p>Speed: determines which player/opponent takes the first turn.
</br></br></p>
	<p>Evasiveness: determines likelihood of character dodging opponent’s attack. (counters accuracy)
</br></br></p>
	<p>Accuracy: determines likelihood of attacks landing. (counters evasiveness)
</br></br></p>
	<p>Types are a set of elements which the player character may specialize in, each will have various advantages/disadvantages with regard to other types, and will have their own specialities. Likely 3 - 4 types total.
</br></br></p>
	<p>AI opponents (so that player may have something to fight).
</br></br></p>
	<p>Default characters: If we don’t get to leveling systems or customizability, we may have characters that the player may select (likely one per type). These characters would have a set appearance and move set.
</br></br></p>


	<h3>Desired</h3>
	<p>Leveling system in which winning combat leads to experience earned. Level up may offer stat increase, or new move availability.
</br></br></p>
	<p>Currency dropped by opponents so that the player may purchase items.
</br></br></p>
	<p>Items: things that the player may equip to buff themselves, or change looks.
</br></br></p>
	<p>Stat: Attack: determines overall damage output.</br></br></p>
	<p>Stat: Defense: counteracts the attack stat.</br></br></p>

	<h3>Optional</h3>
	<p>Looks: player customizable character.
</br></br></p>
	<p>Online play: The ability for the player to connect to and battle other players.
</br></br></p>
	<p>Hub: Area where stores/online chat may take place. (without a hub we may have a menu screen which facilitates store actions / online play.
</br></br></p>
