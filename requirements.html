    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
       <h4>1.1 Purpose of Product<br></h4>
       <p>We are going to create a turn-based fighting game, so the purpose of this product will be to entertain our users. We want to make a fun and catchy game that people can play for their own personal enjoyment.<br></p>
       
       <h4>1.2 Scope of Product<br></h4>
       <p>This product will be based on a combat system in which players can fight Non-Playable Characters. It will include a variety of players stats (such as health, speed, evasiveness, and accuracy) as well as different moves that can heal the player, attack the opponent, or manipulate stats. The fighters will have different stats that work differently against each other, and we will program AI enemies to fight against the players. We would also like to include leveling, items, and an interface to allow players to move between battles. The graphics of our game will be two dimensional. It will not include open-world character movement or player-versus-player combat.<br></p>
       
       <h4>1.3 Acronyms, Abbreviations, Definitions<br></h4>
       <p>Players stats:<br>
          ---Health (HP): primary part of combat, when hits zero, combat is over.<br>
	  ---Speed: determines which player/opponent takes the first turn.<br>
          ---Evasiveness: determines likelihood of character dodging opponent’s attack.<br>
          ---Accuracy: determines likelihood of attacks landing.<br>
       Fighter Types:<br>
	  ---Water, Earth, Fire, Air.<br></p>
	    
       <h4>1.4 References<br></h4>
       <p>N/A. No references needed.<br></p>
 
       <h2>2. General Description of Product<br></h2>
       <p>The goal of our project is to make a turn-based combat game in which wizard-like characters can fight against a variety of opponents. There will be four different types of fighters: Fire, water, earth, and air. They will counteract each other in different ways, so that each type will have its own strengths/weaknesses. The players will have different moves that they can choose from to fight their opponent. These moves will include healing moves, attacking moves, or stat-changing moves. The stats that each player will have are health, speed, evasiveness, and accuracy (we will add attack and defense if we can). Each battle will be over when either the player or the opponents’ health points reach 0. We also hope to incorporate a market system in which players can earn money from battles, then use that money to buy items that can aid them in their future fights. We also want to add a transition page to allow players to navigate which opponents they want to fight at a given time.<br></p> 
       
       <h4>2.1 Context of Product<br></h4>
       <p>We will make the game in Unity which will create a .exe file.<br></p>
	    
       <h4>2.2 Domain Model with Description<br></h4>
       <p>Our domain model is based on the way that the battle system will work. There are three main components: Type, Attack, and Stats. These will determine the way that the player is able to battle against their opponent. Each component has sub-components as seen in the model. Sub-components can also change the other factors. For instance, the stat-altering attacks have a direct effect on a player’s stats. Furthermore, different fighting types will have different attacks.<br></p>

       <h4>2.3 Product Functions (general)<br></h4>
       <p>This product will be capable of supporting single-player gameplay. Its functions will be to support players fighting against a variety of opponents using different moves to attack, heal, or alter stats.<br></p>

       <h4>2.4 User Characteristics and Expectations<br></h4>
       <p>We plan to incorporate a tutorial in the beginning of the game, so users will be able to learn the game controls without having any experience. The only expectation is that users will be able to learn how to battle from the tutorial. There are no prerequisites or abilities that they require.<br></p>

       <h4>2.5 Constraints<br></h4>
       <p>The game will only support single player mode.<br></p>
	    
       <h4>2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies<br></h4>
       <p>System requirements to run Unity:<br>
          ---Windows. OS: Any modern OS. Processor: 1.1 GHz Processor. Memory: 2 GB RAM.<br>
          ---Mac. OS: Any modern OS. Processor: 1.1 GHz Processor. Memory: 2 GB RAM.<br>
	  ---Linux. OS: Any modern OS. Processor: 1.1 GHz Processor. Memory: 2 GB RAM.<br></p>
