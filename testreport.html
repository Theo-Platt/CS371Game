    <h2>Component Testing</h2>
    <p>Because our battle is a turn-based fighting game, there are several components of the battle that we had to test separately. For instance, we had to test our battle HUD, or the screen on which the battle takes place. We also needed to test each individual stat for the battles, so we ran different fights and monitored how effectively the stats affected the fight. These components were all eventually implemented into the final battle system.<br></p>
    <p>We chose our tests based on our user stories and what a player would expect from the game. The components that we chose to test are all major factors of the outcome of each battle. They covered the expected requirements because each piece that we tested contributes to the overall fairness of our battles. <br></p>
    <h2>System Testing</h2>
    <p>Because we are using Unity to create our game, our system has mostly been completed for us. We test the system by running demo battles against NPC opponents. Because the systematic structure of each battle is generally the same, we do not have to run many test cases to ensure that the system is working.<br></p>
    <h2>Acceptance Testing</h2>
    <p>We used our User Stories to test if our game would meet a user's expectations for functionality. We tested each user story to see if the system is adequate for our players.<br></p>
    <p>1.1: Animations -- Completely implemented. We tested each animation in different battles, and they all run as they are meant to.<br></p>
    <p>1.2: Tutorial -- Not yet implemented. We have not finished setting up our tutorial.<br></p>
    <p>1.3: Balance -- Completely implemented. We have tuned all of the fighter stats so that battles are evenly matched.<br></p>
    <p>1.4 Non-Playable Characters -- Completely implemented. Our NPCs are programmed to fight against players so that they are close in skill level.<br></p>
    <p>1.5 Navigation -- Not yet implemented. We have not yet finished our battle transition system.<br></p>
    <p>1.6 Progress metric -- Completely implemented. Players can see their own health bar, as well as their opponents, which changes as the fight progresses.<br></p>
    <p>1.7 Player Stats -- Completely implemented. Player stats affect all different aspects of battles.<br></p>
    <p>1.8 Save Progress -- Not yet implemented. We have not developed a system to save a player's progress in our game.<br></p>
    <p>1.9 Moves -- Completely implemented. All moves have been tested and work as we expected them to.<br></p>
